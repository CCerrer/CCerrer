### Hello world!

My name is Ferrer,
computer science student and future billionaire.

I'm currently stuying to be a fullstack developer. 
By learning a new thing every day and creating things I'll get there 🤩 

 I would really appreciate it if you take a look at my new projects
and give some feedback? 🤖

Right now I'm studying React to implement in my [fullstack project](https://github.com/CCerrer/Cafe-Tracker)
